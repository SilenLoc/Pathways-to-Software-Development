# Intro

## Goal

This book is for everyone who wants to get into Software Development.The goal of the content is to get a clean view into the world of software development.

## Why

My wife and sister in law are in one or the other way interested into the field but for both it is hard to create touchpoints to even start understanding what software development entails and what it really means.The misuse of terms is a general and ongoing issue in the IT world and leads to confusion 

just search in any search engine:
```
misuse of terms in the IT world, examples
```

and you will find a lot of examples of current misused words.
This creates an entry barrier for beginners, because they can not even imagine what something means for them if no one else does.

## Limitations

This book must be opionated otherwise I would have lied in the prevoius chapter.
Opionated does not mean uninformed or full of my opions only.
That leads to the book being biased towards my experience. To counteract that I will add a small meta about what I write:

- My opinion
- Sourced (with source)
- Mixed (with source)
