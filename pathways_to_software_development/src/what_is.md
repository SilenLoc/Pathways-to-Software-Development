# What is a Software Developer


## The term "software development" (source)

When looking only at the beginning of the wiki articl the term is quite easy to boil it down:



Programming and maintaining the source code is the central step of this process, but it also includes conceiving the project, evaluating its feasibility, analyzing the business requirements, software design, testing, to release.

## The term "software developmer" (opinion)

While the term software development entails something like "evaluating its feasibility" this does not mean that a software developer will do that. However being a part of all of the software development topics is normal.

The books is structured over those topics but will always try to show where those topics are intertwined or related.
